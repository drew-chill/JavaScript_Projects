### Weather App
In this tutorial we are going to create a Weather App with JavaScript. To access weather data, we go to OpenWeatherMap webpage to get your weather api key.
Go to https://openweathermap.org, then click API Keys to get your own weather api key after signing in.

## Warning
Your weather api key is needed to replace it in index.js file on line 9 :

```javascript
const APIKey = 'Your Api Key';
```
